(Title slide)
Good morning, my name is Stephanie.
I want to start by saying thank you to the organisers for this opportunity to speak to you today.
I am supervised Prof. Kerrie Mengersen and Dr. Earl Duncan. This work is also co-supervised by Prof. Dianne Cook at Monash University.

I have been focused on visual inference, this is what people learn when shown a display.
We have used displays of spatial distributions, which show relationships over space.
These displays can be considered visual statistics.
We have explored how our use of maps or alternative visualisations allow us to see spatial distributions.

# Australian Cancer Atlas
???
This work was inspired by the Australian Cancer Atlas.
This is an online, interactive web tool for exploring the impact of cancer in Australia, through the visualisation of Incidence Rates and Excess Death Rates.

This is not the first of its kind, there are many sites and published works which explore the spatial distributions of cancer throughout the world.

# Problem
## Where are the communities?

???
This map may be appropriate in some cases, but for our work, we are interested in the spatial distribution of cancer, and cancer affects people.
Communities with similar genetic predispositions, lifestyles and access to services.
The statistical areas may have similar amounts of people, but the areas  with largest land mass are over represented.
So when we try to present population statistics visually to explain spatial distributions we are missing a vast amount of information.

When the goal is to see the population, there are several visualisation methods that have been developed.
